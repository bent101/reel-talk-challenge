# Todos and notes

## Todos

### High priority

- profile in header
- fix weird image sizing on birthday page
- fix no semibold font
- make birthday movies carousel functional
- functional search on genre selection

### Medium priority

- yellow favicon? (white/black favicon can blend in with the browser tab in light/dark mode)
- fully responsive
  - header
  - images squishing
- re-export images with higher quality
- improve the design system, the tailwind's looking kinda funky in places
  - no transparent colors
- validate name/email/password (maybe use [Zod](https://zod.dev/))

### Low priority

- get progress bar css animation working if possible (maybe `useState` instead of diff. routes)

## Opinions

- replace "show more"/"show less" on genre selection with scroll
- if the user is allowed to pick less than 5 favorites, make that clearer; otherwise, don't let them
- change fonts: this font is too high and might not have a semibold (and may or may not have been illegally downloaded)
- make genres variable width, rounded full, more compact, no white bg (stands out too much)
- **Finish** instead of **Next** on the last step
